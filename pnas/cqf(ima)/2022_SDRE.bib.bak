	by an inverted pendulum robot and realize a navigation function in
	a real environment. The system consists of two cooperative subsystems:
	a balancing-and-traveling control subsystem and a navigation subsystem.
	Position errors of the inverted pendulum robot are often caused by
	a drift error in the gyro sensor and a change in the center of gravity
	by a loaded baggage when applying the linear state feedback control
	method for balancing and traveling. We have reduced the position
	errors for navigation by resetting the balance position occasionally
	while traveling with simple methods without an external observer
	or alternative sensors. In this paper, we state the method and show
	the experimental results of navigation in a real environment by the
	implemented robot system.},
